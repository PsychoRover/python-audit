# Singularity-Audit

Some comments regarding your requests:
- Regarding point (g) where you asked for screenshots of the terminal display and database search, I have included the actual log files for your review. I hope this meets your satisfaction.
- As for point (h) where you requested SQL queries and screenshots for certain scenarios, I intentionally utilized ORM functionality extensively instead of string queries for enhanced security purposes.


## Installation

Build using Github Codespaces: Code -> Codespaces Tab -> Build

Or build using VSCode Remote Explorer

    
## Troubleshooting
Might be that Poetry wouldn't set the virtualenv as the interpreter.
- Run `where python`
- Copy `singularity-auditd` path
- CMD/Ctrl + Shift + P -> Search for "Python: Select Interpreter"
- Try to run.
