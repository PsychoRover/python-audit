# Python-Audit

## Installation

Build using Github Codespaces: Code -> Codespaces Tab -> Build

Or build using VSCode Remote Explorer

    
## Troubleshooting
Might be that Poetry wouldn't set the virtualenv as the interpreter.
- Run `where python`
- Copy `singularity-auditd` path
- CMD/Ctrl + Shift + P -> Search for "Python: Select Interpreter"
- Try to run.
